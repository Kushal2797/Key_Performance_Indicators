Compiling and analyzing HR data can be hard when teams are focused on improving employee engagement across the organization. You need an easy way to help employees get insights about their productivity and give companies an aggregated view of their teams to improve processes.


## Details  

Agile HR Analytics is an end-to-end analytics and reporting solution – built on Tableau – to help organizations discover useful HR insights for strategic decision making. It enables HR professionals to make data-driven decisions to attract, manage, and retain employees, which improves ROI. It helps leaders make decisions to create better work environments and maximize employee productivity.  
 
Tableau uses an interactive dashboard that makes it easy for stakeholders to see insights. 

Employees can learn about their individual productivity with MyAnalytics. It shows them how much time they spend in meetings versus how much time they have to focus on work. It’s completely private, so employees only see their own data. 

Companies can use Workplace Analytics to view and evaluate their team productivity. Workplace Analytics pulls aggregated results from MyAnalytics, but the employees’ information remains private. Managers can see if their teams spend too much time in meetings or responding to emails and set up new processes to improve productivity.
